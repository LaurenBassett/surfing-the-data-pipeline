    "## Introduction: Is Web Scraping Legal?\n",
    "Web scraping is the practice of downloading the raw HTML code that generates a website, and instead of parsing the code to display it like we do with a web browser whenever we navigate to a page, we dig through the code for data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are **significant legal and ethical questions** regarding web scraping. Right now, there is a court case - [HiQ Labs vs. LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn) - that will establish whether and under what conditions web scraping is legal. \n",

    "\n",
    "HiQ is a company that scraps data from individuals' LinkedIn profiles to compile data to use to build models that predict whether employees will leave their positions for new jobs. They use the insights from these models to consult with businesses to reduce employee turnover. In 2017 LinkedIn issued a Cease and Desist order to HiQ and took steps to prevent anyone including HiQ from deploying scrapers on profiles. Because HiQ's business model is entirely dependent on collecting data from LinkedIn profiles, this action by LinkedIn would have caused HiQ to go out of business. Instead, HiQ filed a lawsuit against LinkedIn in federal court. HiQ argued that user profiles contain data that are owned by the LinkedIn users themselves who intend to make that information public using the LinkedIn platform -- and so, because the data owners are sharing their own data, HiQ should be able to access that data. LinkedIn argued that the HiQ's scraping of user data amounts to theft, is a violation of the [Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), and violates LinkedIn users' privacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017 a federal district court issued an injunction that prevented LinkedIn from blocking HiQ's scraping scripts. The case was appealed to the Circuit Court, where [this injuction was upheld in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-linkedin-profiles/microsofts-linkedin-loses-appeal-over-access-to-user-profiles-idUSKCN1VU21W). In March 2020 LinkedIn filed for the case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is likely that this case will be decided at the highest level in the United States sometime in the next year. What the Supreme Court decides will have [massive ramifications](https://www.natlawreview.com/print/article/linkedin-files-petition-to-supreme-court-hiq-web-scraping-case) on the use of web scraping, data science, and on the tech industry at large. It will establish whether web scraping is legal, legal with restrictions, or illegal, and it will have implications for data ownership and the extent to which large tech companies control and own the data that exist on their platforms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even if scraping is legal, it might not be ethical. Scraping calls a server that is not designed for the transference of data the way an API is. As such, many repeated calls (from bots) to a website for the purpose of scraping data might overwhelm the server, keeping the website's owners from being able to achieve their purpose for having the website. This [article by James Densmore](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01) outlines some ethical considerations for scrapers and for website owners, and lays out the following code of conduct: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"I, the web scraper will live by the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you have a public API that provides the data I’m looking for, I’ll use it and avoid scraping all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will always provide a User Agent string that makes my intentions clear and provides a way for you to contact me with questions or concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will request data at a reasonable rate. I will strive to never be confused for a DDoS attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will only save the data I absolutely need from your page. If all I need it OpenGraph meta-data, that’s all I’ll keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will respect any content I do keep. I’ll never pass it off as my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will look for ways to return value to you. Maybe I can drive some (real) traffic to your site or credit you in an article or post.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will respond in a timely fashion to your outreach and work with you towards a resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will scrape for the purpose of creating new value from the data, not to duplicate it.\n",
    "\n",
    " . . . . I, the site owner will live by the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will allow ethical scrapers to access my site as long as they are not a burden on my site’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will respect transparent User Agent strings rather than blocking them and encouraging use of scrapers masked as human visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will reach out to the owner of the scraper (thanks to their ethical User Agent string) before blocking permanently. A temporary block is acceptable in the case of site performance or ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I understand that scrapers are a reality of the open web.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will consider public APIs to provide data as an alternative to scrapers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, while scraping appears to exist in a legal and ethical grey area, there is a lot of litigation and many arguments that suggest that once information is posted publically on a website, that there is no longer an expectation of privacy, and the data is open for anyone to use. But be careful when you use web scraping! If there IS an expectation of privacy, such as for any website with a password or other restrictions on access, then the legality and ethics of web scraping are much more dubious. If an API is available, it's available for a reason, and it's the correct ethical decision to use the API instead of scraping. Use care and judgment."

    "## How Websites Prevent You From Scraping\n",
    "This discussion follows the excellent overview by a Stack Overflow and GitHub contributor with the username JonasCz (I wish I knew this user's real name!) on [how to prevent web scraping](https://github.com/JonasCz/How-To-Prevent-Scraping/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the restrictions and challenges you will encounter when scraping data, put yourself in the position of a website's owner:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you own and maintain a website, there are many reasons why you might want to prevent web scraping bots from accessing the data on your website. Maybe the bots will overload the traffic to your site and make it impossible for your website to work as you intend. You might be running a business through this website and sharing the data in mass transfers would undercut your business. For whatever reason, you are now faced with a challenge: how to you prevent automated scraping of the data on your webpage while still allowing individual customers to view your website?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping will require issuing HTTP requests to a particular web address with a tool like `requests`, sometimes many times in a short period. Every HTTP request is logged by the server that receives the request, and these logs contain the IP address of the entity making the request. If too many requests are made by the same IP address, the server can block that IP address. The coding logic to automatically identify and block overactive IP addresses is simple, so many websites include these security measures. Some blocks are temporary, placing a rate limit on these requests to slow down the scrapers, and some blocks reroute scrapers through a CAPTCHA (which stands for \"Completely Automated Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart\") to prevent robots like a scraper from accessing the website. JonasCz recommends that these security measures look at other factors as well: the speed of actions on the website, the amount of data requested, and other factors that can identify a user when the IP address is masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stronger gates, such as making users register for a username and password with email confirmation to use your website, are effective against scraping bots. But they also turn away individuals who wouldn't want to jump through those hoops. Saving all text as images on your server will prevent bots from accessing the text very easily, but it makes the website harder to use and violates regulations that protect people with disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, JonasCz recommends building your website in a way that never reveals the entirety of the data you own, and never reveals the private API endpoints you use to display the data. Also, web scrapers are fragile: they are built to pull data from the specific HTML structure of a particular website. Changing the HTML code frequently or using different versions of the code based on geographic location will break the scrapers that are built for that code. JonasCz also suggests adding \"honeypot\" links to the HTML code that will not be displayed to legitimate users but will be followed by scrapers that recursively follow links, and taking action against the agents that follow these links: block their IP addresses, require a CAPTCHA, or deliver fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important piece of information in a request is the user agent header (which we discuss in more detail [below](#useragent)). JonasCz recommends looking at this information and blocking requests when the user agent is blank or matches information from agents that have previously been identified as malicious bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the steps you would take to protect your data from bots if you owned a website, you should have greater insight into why a web scraping endeavor may fail. Your web scraper might not be malicious, but might still violate the rules that the website owner setup to guard against bots. These rules are usually listed explicitly in a file on the server, usually called `robots.txt`. Some tips for reading and understanding a `robots.txt` file are here: https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/how-to-read-and-respect-robots-file/\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this document we will be scraping data on the playlist of a radio station from https://spinitron.com/. This website has a `robots.txt` file here: https://spinitron.com/robots.txt, which reads:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User-agent: *\n",
    "Crawl-delay: 10\n",
    "Request-rate: 1/10\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `User-agent: *` line tells us that the next two lines apply to all user agent strings. `Crawl-delay: 10` places a limit on the frequency with which our scraper can make a request from this website. In this case, individual requests must be made 10 second apart. `Request-rate: 1/10` tells us that our scraper is only allowed to access one page every 10 seconds, and that we are not allowed to make requests from more than one page at the same time."

    "## Using `requests` with a User Agent Header\n",
    "As the articles by James Densmore and JonasCz described, requests are much more likely to get blocked by websites if the request does not specify a header that contains a user agent. An HTTP header is a parameter that gets sent along with the HTTP request that contains metadata about the request. A user agent header contains contact and identification information about the person making the request. If there is any issue with your web scraper, you want to give the website owner a chance to contact you directly about that problem. If you do not feel comfortable being contacted by the website's owner, you should reconsider whether you should be scraping that website.\n",

If there are measures taken by a website to hide that data, possibly by calling server-side Javascript to populate data fields, or by saving data as image files, then we won't be able to access the data with an HTML parser. `selenium` has more features to extract more complicated data and circumvent anti-scraping measures, such as taking a screenshot of the webpage in a browser and using optical character recognition (OCR) to pull data directly from the image. However, `selenium` requires each request to be loaded in a web browser, so it can be quite a bit slower than `BeautifulSoup()`.

    "### Constructing a Data Frame from HTML Data\n",
    "Next we need to place these data into a clean data frame. For that, we will need to keep the valid data while dropping the HTML tags. We stored the tags with the artists, songs, albums, and times in separate lists. Every name is stored as a navigable string in the HTML tags, so to extract these names we need to loop across the elements of the list. The simplest loop for this task is called a **list comprehension**, which has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "*newlist* `= [` *expression* `for` *item* `in` *oldlist* `if` *condition* `]`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this syntax, we are creating a new list by iteratively performing operations on the elements of an existing list (*oldlist*). *item* is a token that we will use to represent one item of the existing list. *expression* is the same Python code we would use on a single element of the existing list, except we replace the name of the element with the token defined with *item*. Finally *condition* is an optional part of this code which sets a filter by which only certain elements of the old list are transformed and placed into the new list (there's an example of conditioning in a comprehension loop in the section on [spiders](#spider)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to extract the navigable string from every element of `artistlist`, we can set *item* to `a`, *expression* to `a.string`, and *list* to `artistlist`:"
